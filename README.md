# Submission note

NB: Some spacings (eg: trigger menu) may not meet requirements because I couldn’t access the sketch file provided to me due to expired license.
I also left the css directory just in case

I’ve been able to meet all requirements given for the challenge but I thought I should throw some light on certain decisions I made while on the quest.

### Data

I made a clone of my data in an object and exported it the main component. This could be improved by replacing it with data from an API and consumed via fetch etc.

### Card layout

I achieved various card layouts by testing for availability of specific data properties, so they adjust and render the cards based on that.

### CSS

I wrote my css in Styled Component in order to gain some flexibility around applying styles based on conditions. Also I wrote this styles in each component they apply to. This can also be done by having a styles directory and placing all styles in there then exporting to various components.

### Title

I truncated the title of the card with css style but it can also be done with javascript by getting the string length and proceeding it with ellipses.

### Icons

I pulled in ant design icons. Svgs can be used as well

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
